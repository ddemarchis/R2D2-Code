# R2D2-Code
Custom arduino code for my R2 build......
Hello fellow builders....I've decided to share my code in an effort to help other builders out there who might be looking to do the same sort
of things with their droid that I've done with mine.  Please note....if you simply take this code and copy and paste it into your droid, things won't work!!
Everything in my droid is most likely set up completely different than yours.  Instead, take this code and use it as a starting point for what you're trying to do.
If, for example, you've decided to install a "fire extinguisher" in your droid, check out the "fire extinguisher" subroutine in my code to see how I was able to
accomplish that.  Or, suppose you're wanting to install an LCD screen in your droid to show Leia's message...well then, check out that subroutine in my code to
see how that was done.  

And please note, I must give credit to Chris James (creator of the Stealth Control System) and John Thompson (frettedlogic on astromech) for the "base code" that I 
used to get things up and running for me.  I took their code as a starting point and modified, edited, added to, and deleted from in order to do the things I
wanted to do with my droid.  And that's exactly what I'm hoping this code does for you...take mine as a starting point, and go from there.

My droid uses the Stealth Control System and makes use of 4 Arduino pro-mini servo expanders that Chris James offers.  I have 2 of those servo expanders in the dome,
and 2 of them in the body.  Therefore, you will find 4 sketches in this library....two different dome sketches, and two different body sketches.  In the top of those
sketches, I've tried to document the various routines the sketch contains, as well as an editing history of each sketch.  If there is anything you think I might be able 
to help with, please don't hesitate to reach me on astromech....daviddemarchis1971
